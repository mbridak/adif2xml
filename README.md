# adif2xml

Converts an ADIF file with the name of QSO.adi in the same directory as the
executable to an XML file with the name of QSO.xml

Install library requirements with:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The QSO.adi file and QSO.xml file included here are just for example/testing
and proof of life.
